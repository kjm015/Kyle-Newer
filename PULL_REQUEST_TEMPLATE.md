# Pull Request Template
If you are committing changes that add a command, your pull request name should be in the format:
`command/yourCommandName`

If your pull request fixes or addresses some issue, it should look like this:
`fix/yourFix`

If you are cleaning the code or revising some old code, format it as such:
`clean/classesToBeCleaned`

Other than that, we're not very picky. Just don't go overboard with the names. If your pull request name is not indicitive of what the changes represent, maybe you should rename it.
