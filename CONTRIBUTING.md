# Contributing Guidelines

So you want to work on New Kyle, huh? You think you have what it takes?

Well, it's not that complicated of a project. Honestly, anyone with a working knowledge of programming can probably figure out what's going on here.
That's okay. This whole project is a side hobby and learning experience for those involved in it. If you don't understand what's going on, we get it.

However, you should probably get to know how we format things before contributing any real code to the main project. 

# How We Do Things
While this is a learning experience for all, we also want to make sure that this project, you know, actually works. Therefore, while we actively encourage people to explore and
mess with their code and the code that we have already, we have many checks and balances to ensure that our overall structure is not compromised through carelessness or negligence.

One thing to note is that you cannot push your changes directly to the master program. Instead, one must make a branch of the changes that they wish to make before it gets considered
for merging into the real project.

Once you're sure enough to put your code up to the master branch, you must make a pull request detailing the changes that you've made and why you think it should be included in the whole
project.

On top of this, all branches must go through two waves of automated quality checks before they can be submitted for review. These checks make sure that your code is both functional and
(to a reasonable degree) elegant. 

Finally, once a pull request passes its status checks, it must go up for review before the other contributors. Now, any number of contributors can submit their own review on a pull request,
but in order for it to be merge-ready, the pull request must be reviewed by one of the CODE OWNERS of the project. 

After all of these checks have been approved, congratulations! Your changes will go through, and your contribution will be logged in the overarching progress of the program.

# Other Stuff
Some other things to note:

Don't just push changes for the sake of pushing changes. Have a purpose behind what you're doing, and make it clear what you are changing and why.

That being said, have fun, and don't be afraid to make mistakes!
